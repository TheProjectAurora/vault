Azure DevOps is a series of collaboration and automation tools, formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services. The currently available components are: Azure Boards for project tracking with Agile methods, Azure Pipelines for building and releasing with continuous integration, Azure Repos for storing source code in Git repositories, Azure Test Plans for keeping track of manual and exploratory testing, and Azure Artifacts for storing and sharing code packages. Azure DevOps combines tools to track your work as well as to deploy and test code changes. After all, DevOps is all about the tight feedback loop so that you can build and release often with confidence. If you're already using Azure, then using Azure DevOps is pretty much a no-brainer since it is well integrated in the ecosystem. Even if you're using some other public cloud, such as AWS, you can still use Azure DevOps to track your projects. AWS actually has a Toolkit for Azure DevOps which integrates with some AWS services and lets you run CloudFormation templates to manage your AWS resources. For each Azure DevOps component you can find a replacement from elsewhere. You can track work in Jira, keep code in GitHub, and store packages in Artifactory. Each one of these is a perfectly fine product on their own. The main benefit of Azure DevOps comes from having everything in the same place without having to integrate everything manually. The Extension Marketplace contains integrations to different services, so you could create work items from Slack conversations, or automatically deploy your mobile app to the Apple App Store.","title":"Azure DevOps"},{"location":"azure/azure-devops/#azure-devops","text":"","title":"Azure DevOps"},{"location":"azure/azure-devops/#what-is-azure-devops","text":"Azure DevOps is a series of collaboration and automation tools, formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services.
